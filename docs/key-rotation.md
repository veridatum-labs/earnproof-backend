# Cryptographic key rotation: identifiers, lifecycle, and operator runbook

This document defines the key identifier and lifecycle policy for every
cryptographic purpose in the backend, and gives operators a rehearsed
procedure for rotating each one. It is the reference for the "Create a
cryptographic key-rotation rehearsal and runbook" production-readiness
work.

Scope: this document defines policy for all five cryptographic purposes in
the system. Code changes were made only for payment-encryption keys (the
only purpose that previously had a single, unversioned key and no rotation
path). Session signing and credential signing already have a rotation
policy defined below but are not code-changed in this pass (see
"Deferred: session and credential signing" below for why that is a safe,
explicitly scoped trade-off). Verification-event hash salts and webhook
HMAC secrets already have adequate rotation mechanisms and are documented
for completeness and consistency, not changed.

## 1. Cryptographic purposes and key identifiers

Every distinct cryptographic purpose has its own key material and its own
identifier namespace. Keys are never shared across purposes.

| Purpose | Env var(s) | Key identifier | Rotation support |
|---|---|---|---|
| Payment amount / webhook secret encryption (AES-256-GCM) | `PAYMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `PAYMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY_V0`, `_V1`, ... + `PAYMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY_VERSION` | Numeric version embedded in ciphertext (`enc:v<N>:...`) | Yes — staged, dual-read (this pass) |
| Verification-event metadata hashing (HMAC-SHA256) | `VERIFICATION_HASH_SALT_V0`, `_V1`, ... + `VERIFICATION_HASH_SALT_VERSION` | Numeric version stored per-row (`saltVersion` column) | Yes — pre-existing pattern, mirrored by payment encryption |
| Session token hashing | `SESSION_SECRET` | None (single key) | Documented policy only, no code change |
| Credential signing (HMAC-SHA256 over canonicalized payload) | `CREDENTIAL_SIGNING_SECRET` | None (single key) | Documented policy only, no code change |
| Webhook delivery signing (HMAC-SHA256) | Per-webhook `signingSecret`, stored encrypted per row via the payment-encryption key | Webhook row ID (implicit) | Yes — per-entity, not globally rotated (already fine) |

Each purpose's key is decodable/derivable independently: compromising the
payment-encryption key does not expose the session secret, the credential
signing secret, or any individual webhook's signing secret, and vice
versa.

## 2. Key lifecycle states

Every versioned key identifier moves through the following states. States
apply per-version, not per-purpose — a purpose can have several versions
alive in different states simultaneously during a rotation window.

| State | Meaning | Configuration |
|---|---|---|
| **active** | The version new writes/signatures use. | `..._VERSION` env var points to this version's number. |
| **retiring** | Still configured and loaded for reads (decrypt/verify), but no longer used for new writes. | Version's `..._V<N>` env var still set; `..._VERSION` points elsewhere. |
| **retired** | No longer configured anywhere. Any data still encrypted/signed under this version cannot be processed. | Version's `..._V<N>` env var removed entirely. |
| **compromised** | An active or retiring version whose key material may have leaked. Handled via the emergency path (§5), not the staged path. | See §5. |

For payment encryption specifically: versions are loaded from
`PAYMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY_V0`, `_V1`, ... sequentially, stopping at the first
gap (same convention `VerificationEventService` already uses for
`VERIFICATION_HASH_SALT_V*`). The unversioned `PAYMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is
treated as an implicit version 0 when `PAYMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY_V0` is not
set, so existing deployments and existing ciphertext keep working without
any environment changes — this is the "version 0 forever" backward
compatibility guarantee.

`PaymentEncryptionKeyringService`
(`src/common/crypto/payment-encryption-keyring.service.ts`) loads this
keyring once per process from `ConfigService` and exposes `.encrypt()`
(always uses the active version) and `.decrypt()` (looks up whichever
version the ciphertext says it was written with). It never logs key
material — startup diagnostics log only version numbers, never key bytes
(see §6).

### Ciphertext format: format version vs. key version

The on-disk encoding is `enc:v<keyVersion>:<iv>:<tag>:<ciphertext>`. The
`v<N>` segment is the **key version**, not a wire-format version — there is
currently only one wire format (AES-256-GCM with a 12-byte IV and 16-byte
tag, base64url-encoded fields). If the wire format ever needs to change
independently of key rotation, add a distinct format marker rather than
overloading this field (e.g. `enc2:v<N>:...`), so key-version parsing and
format parsing never become ambiguous. The legacy `redacted:<base64>`
prefix (pre-encryption placeholder format) is unrelated and passed through
unchanged by `decryptProtectedAmount`.

## 3. Staged rotation: dual-read behavior

Staged rotation is the default, safe path for rotating a key with no
downtime and no risk of losing access to existing data.

**Before rotation** — one key configured, e.g. only `PAYMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
(implicit v0). All reads and writes use v0.

**Stage 1 — introduce the new version.** Set `PAYMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY_V1` to
a freshly generated 32-byte key (base64 or hex; see §7 for generation).
Leave `PAYMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY_VERSION` unset (or `0`) — writes still go to
v0. Both v0 and v1 are now loaded; nothing observable changes yet. This
step exists purely to get the new key material distributed to every
process before it is depended on.

**Stage 2 — cut writes over.** Set `PAYMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY_VERSION=1` and
restart/redeploy. From this point:
- All **new** ciphertext is written as `enc:v1:...`.
- All **old** ciphertext (`enc:v0:...`) continues to decrypt normally —
  the version segment in the ciphertext tells `decryptProtectedAmount`
  which key to use, so old and new data coexist with zero read failures.
  This is the dual-read guarantee: a service instance restarted at any
  point during this stage, with both `_V0` and `_V1` configured, can read
  both eras of data.

**Stage 3 — let old data age out (retiring).** Leave `PAYMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY_V0`
configured for as long as any row might still hold `enc:v0:...` ciphertext
(payments and webhook secrets are effectively never rewritten in place, so
in practice this window is indefinite unless a backfill job re-encrypts
old rows under v1 — no such backfill exists today; retiring v0 is an
explicit operator decision, not automatic).

**Stage 4 — retire.** Once satisfied nothing still needs v0 (verified via a
backfill, a data audit, or an accepted retention/expiry cutoff), remove
`PAYMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY_V0` from configuration entirely and restart. Any
ciphertext still tagged `enc:v0:...` now fails to decrypt with a typed,
unambiguous `UnknownKeyVersionError` (never silent corruption, never a
generic crash) — this is the explicit "retired" boundary the acceptance
criteria call for. `test/crypto/key-rotation.spec.ts` rehearses exactly
this sequence, including the restart step, with synthetic test keys.

The same four-stage shape applies to `VERIFICATION_HASH_SALT_*` (already
implemented) and would apply to `SESSION_SECRET` /
`CREDENTIAL_SIGNING_SECRET` if they are ever versioned (see §7 note on
extending the pattern).

## 4. Rollback

Rollback undoes Stage 2 (the write cutover) while still inside the
retiring window (Stage 3) — i.e. before the old version has been retired.

**Procedure:** set `PAYMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY_VERSION` back to the previous
version number and restart/redeploy. Because the previous version's key
was never removed from configuration (it only stopped being the active
write key), this is a same-shape config change to the forward rotation —
no data migration, no re-encryption, no downtime.

**Safe limits on rollback:**
- Rollback is only safe **before retirement** (§2). Once a version's env
  var has been removed and a restart has happened without it, rollback
  requires restoring that key's original material from your secrets
  backup — the running process has no memory of a retired key.
- Data written under the newer version *while it was active* remains
  `enc:v<newVersion>:...` after rollback. Rolling back the write version
  does not retroactively change already-written ciphertext, and does not
  stop that data from continuing to decrypt correctly — the newer key
  must therefore stay configured (not retired) for as long as any data
  written under it might still need to be read, exactly symmetric to the
  forward-rotation retiring rule in §3.
- Rollback is a config-only operation; it never regenerates or discards
  key material, so it carries no risk of data loss as long as the safe
  limits above are respected.

## 5. Compromised-key emergency path

This path is distinct from staged rotation because a compromised key
cannot be trusted to sit in "retiring" for an extended window — the
priority shifts from zero-downtime continuity to limiting exposure.

1. **Do not remove the compromised version's env var yet.** Removing it
   immediately makes all data still encrypted under it permanently
   unreadable (see §2, "retired"). Decide first whether that data needs to
   be read and re-encrypted, or whether losing access to it is acceptable.
2. **Generate a new key version immediately** (`PAYMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY_V<N+1>`,
   a freshly generated value — see §7) and cut writes over
   (`PAYMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY_VERSION=<N+1>`) as an expedited Stage 1+2,
   collapsed into a single deploy rather than the normal two-step rollout,
   since the priority is to stop using the compromised key for new writes
   as fast as possible.
3. **If the compromised key's exposure is severe enough that even
   continued read access is unacceptable** (e.g. the key leaked alongside
   enough ciphertext to make offline decryption feasible outside your
   infrastructure), treat it as retired immediately: remove its env var,
   accept that any un-migrated data under it becomes unreadable, and file
   that data loss as an explicit, logged operator decision — not a side
   effect discovered later.
4. **Evidence to capture**, without ever including key material itself:
   - Which key identifier (purpose + version number) was compromised.
   - Timestamp of the new active version's cutover.
   - Whether the compromised version was retired immediately (§5.3) or
     left retiring for a defined migration window (§5.2), and the
     window's end date if the latter.
   - `PaymentEncryptionKeyringService`'s own startup log lines (version
     numbers and counts only — see §6) from before and after the
     incident, as they show exactly which versions were loaded and active
     at each point in time.
5. **After the incident**, once the compromised version is fully retired,
   confirm via `test/crypto/key-rotation.spec.ts`-style verification (or
   an equivalent check against real data) that ciphertext under the
   retired version now fails closed with `UnknownKeyVersionError` rather
   than silently succeeding — this is the proof that the compromised key
   is actually gone from every running process, not just from the primary
   config source.

## 6. No key material in logs, metrics, or commands

Verified for every file touched in this work:

- `PaymentEncryptionKeyringService` logs only version numbers and counts
  (`"Loaded versions: [0, 1]"`, `"Configured active payment encryption key
  version 5 is not loaded"`) — never the key strings themselves. See
  `src/common/crypto/payment-encryption-keyring.service.ts`.
- `protected-amount.ts`'s error paths (`UnknownKeyVersionError`, the
  32-byte decode-length error) include the key **version number** for
  operator diagnosis, never the key material.
- `VerificationEventService` follows the same rule for
  `VERIFICATION_HASH_SALT_*` — its warnings reference version numbers and
  counts only.
- `WebhookSigningService`, `session.service.ts`, `auth-token.service.ts`,
  and `credentials.service.ts` do not log their secrets; grepped for
  `logger.*secret`, `logger.*[Kk]ey`, and raw secret variable names across
  `src/auth/`, `src/credentials/`, `src/webhooks/`, and
  `src/common/crypto/` as part of this change with no hits.
- None of the four payment-encryption consumer call sites
  (`payments.service.ts`, `proofs.service.ts`,
  `webhook-delivery.service.ts`, `webhooks.service.ts`) log the key,
  ciphertext keys, or decrypted plaintext amounts — only IDs and outcomes.

Operators: never pass key material as a CLI argument (visible in shell
history and process listings) — use environment variables set via the
deployment platform's secret store, exactly as `PAYMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is
today.

## 7. Generating new key versions

```
# Payment encryption key (32 bytes, base64) — for PAYMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY_V<N>
openssl rand -base64 32

# Equivalent, hex-encoded (also accepted)
openssl rand -hex 32
```

The same commands apply to `VERIFICATION_HASH_SALT_V<N>` values. Neither
command, nor its output, should ever appear in application logs, CI logs,
or shell history retained on a shared system — generate directly into the
secret manager where possible (`op run`, `aws secretsmanager`, `vault kv
put`, etc., depending on deployment environment) rather than printing to a
terminal that gets logged.

## 8. Deferred: session and credential signing

`SESSION_SECRET` and `CREDENTIAL_SIGNING_SECRET` are single, unversioned
keys today (`src/auth/session.service.ts`, `src/auth/auth-token.service.ts`,
`src/credentials/credentials.service.ts`). This pass does not add
versioning code for them. This is a scoped trade-off, not an oversight:

- **Session tokens are short-lived** (12-hour default TTL — see
  `DEFAULT_TTL_SECONDS` in `session.service.ts`) and the session store is
  a database lookup by hash, not a self-contained signed token in the
  primary flow (`AuthTokenService`, which does sign self-contained tokens,
  is already marked `@deprecated` in favor of `SessionService`). Rotating
  `SESSION_SECRET` without a dual-read path simply invalidates all
  outstanding sessions — an acceptable, bounded blast radius (users
  re-authenticate) rather than a silent-corruption risk.
- **Credential signing** (`credentials.service.ts`) signs long-lived
  externally-verifiable credentials. This *is* a case where the same
  versioned-key pattern used for payment encryption would be the correct
  future direction — verifiers need to keep validating credentials signed
  under an old key after rotation. It is deferred here strictly to keep
  this change to its documented scope (payment encryption keys, plus
  policy documentation for the rest); implementing it should follow
  exactly the `PaymentEncryptionKeyringService` shape: `CREDENTIAL_SIGNING_SECRET_V0`,
  `_V1`, ..., `CREDENTIAL_SIGNING_SECRET_VERSION`, with the signature
  itself carrying the key version so verification can dual-read.
- **Operator policy in the meantime**: rotating either secret today is a
  hard cutover — plan rotations for low-traffic windows, expect all active
  sessions to be invalidated (`SESSION_SECRET`) and all credentials
  verified against the *old* secret to fail signature checks
  (`CREDENTIAL_SIGNING_SECRET`) until re-issued. Do not rotate
  `CREDENTIAL_SIGNING_SECRET` without a plan to re-issue affected
  credentials, since there is currently no dual-read fallback.

## 9. Why webhook HMAC secrets are not globally rotated

`WebhookSigningService` (`src/webhooks/webhook-signing.service.ts`) signs
outbound webhook deliveries using a **per-webhook-endpoint** secret, stored
encrypted (via the payment-encryption keyring — see §1) in the `Webhook`
row itself, not a single global secret. This is already the correct
rotation model for this purpose:

- Each integrator's endpoint has an independent secret; rotating one
  endpoint's secret cannot affect any other endpoint's verification.
- `WebhooksService.rotateSecret` (see `src/webhooks/webhooks.service.ts`)
  already generates a new random secret, encrypts it with the current
  active payment-encryption key, and returns the raw value to the caller
  exactly once — the standard "rotate a per-entity secret" pattern.
- There is deliberately no "global webhook signing key version" to
  introduce: doing so would only add a layer of indirection without a
  corresponding safety benefit, since blast radius is already contained
  per-endpoint.

The one dependency worth noting: rotating the **payment-encryption key**
(§3) changes how webhook secrets are encrypted at rest, but does not
require touching individual webhook secrets — `WebhookDeliveryService` and
`WebhooksService` both decrypt via `PaymentEncryptionKeyringService`,
which transparently dual-reads across payment-encryption key versions
exactly like any other protected-amount ciphertext.

## 10. Operator rehearsal checklist

Use this checklist to rehearse a payment-encryption key rotation in a
non-production environment before ever running it against production
data. `test/crypto/key-rotation.spec.ts` automates the equivalent sequence
with synthetic keys; this checklist is the operator-facing version against
a real (non-production) deployment.

1. [ ] Generate a new key: `openssl rand -base64 32`. Store it in the
       secret manager as `PAYMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY_V<N+1>`. Confirm it never
       appears in shell history or CI logs.
2. [ ] Deploy with the new version configured but `PAYMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY_VERSION`
       unchanged. Confirm `PaymentEncryptionKeyringService`'s startup log
       shows the new version in `Loaded versions` and no error about the
       active version.
3. [ ] Confirm existing data (payments, webhook secrets) still reads
       correctly — spot-check a few known records through the normal
       application flow (not by inspecting ciphertext directly).
4. [ ] Cut writes over: set `PAYMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY_VERSION=<N+1>`, deploy.
       Confirm a newly-created record's ciphertext is prefixed
       `enc:v<N+1>:` and an old record's is still readable.
5. [ ] Restart the process (or redeploy with no config change) and confirm
       both old and new records still decrypt — this proves dual-read
       survives a fresh process, not just an in-memory cache.
6. [ ] After the agreed retiring window, remove `PAYMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY_V<N>`
       (the old version) and redeploy. Confirm any remaining old-version
       ciphertext now fails with `UnknownKeyVersionError` in logs (not a
       silent failure) and that this was expected/accepted per §3 Stage 4.
7. [ ] Record the rehearsal outcome (versions involved, timestamps, any
       deviations from this checklist) using the evidence fields in §5 as
       a template, even for a routine (non-emergency) rotation — this
       gives the next rotation, or an eventual real incident, a known-good
       baseline to compare against.
