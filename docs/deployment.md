# Deployment

How to build, configure and run the EarnProof API as a container.

The image is defined by [`../Dockerfile`](../Dockerfile). It is a three-stage
build: the toolchain that compiles the application is not the tree that runs it,
so no compiler, test runner or TypeScript source reaches a published image.

## Build

```bash
docker build -t earnproof-api:local .
```

The build takes no arguments and needs no secrets. Nothing in it contacts a
database: the Prisma **client** is generated from `prisma/schema.prisma` at build
time, while `DATABASE_URL` is only read when the process starts.

To pin a different Node minor (it must match [`../.nvmrc`](../.nvmrc), which is
also what CI runs):

```bash
docker build --build-arg NODE_VERSION=20.11.1 -t earnproof-api:local .
```

### What ends up in the image

| Path | Why |
|---|---|
| `dist/` | The compiled application. `node dist/main.js` is the entrypoint. |
| `node_modules/` | Runtime dependencies only, installed with `npm ci --omit=dev`, plus the generated Prisma client. |
| `prisma/` | Schema and migrations, so `prisma migrate deploy` runs from the same artefact that serves traffic. |
| `package.json` | Read by Node and by Prisma; the scripts are not used at runtime. |

Excluded by [`../.dockerignore`](../.dockerignore): `node_modules`, `dist`,
`coverage`, `test/`, `scripts/`, `docs/`, `.git`, `.github`, and every `.env`
file except the example. Anything copied into an image is *in* that image, and
`.env` is the file most likely to be sitting in a working directory.

## Run

```bash
docker run --rm -p 4000:4000 \
  -e NODE_ENV=production \
  -e DATABASE_URL='postgresql://user:password@db.internal:5432/earnproof' \
  -e REDIS_URL='redis://cache.internal:6379' \
  -e APP_URL='https://app.example.com' \
  -e API_URL='https://api.example.com' \
  -e SESSION_SECRET="$SESSION_SECRET" \
  -e CREDENTIAL_SIGNING_SECRET="$CREDENTIAL_SIGNING_SECRET" \
  -e PAYMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY="$PAYMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY" \
  earnproof-api:local
```

Then:

```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/api/v1/health
```

Configuration is validated before the server listens. Invalid configuration is a
startup failure with the offending variable named in the log, never a container
that accepts traffic it cannot serve — see the fail-fast block at the top of
[`../src/main.ts`](../src/main.ts).

### Running the image against local services

`NODE_ENV=production` refuses a `localhost` database or Redis host, and requires
`https://` application URLs, because in production both are almost always a
misconfiguration. To exercise the image against the Compose services, run it in
the development profile and give the container a route to the host:

```bash
docker compose up -d                       # postgres + redis
docker run --rm -p 4000:4000 \
  -e NODE_ENV=development \
  -e DATABASE_URL='postgresql://earnproof:earnproof@host.docker.internal:5432/earnproof' \
  -e REDIS_URL='redis://host.docker.internal:6379' \
  -e SESSION_SECRET=local_dev_secret \
  -e CREDENTIAL_SIGNING_SECRET=local_dev_secret \
  -e PAYMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY=MDEyMzQ1Njc4OWFiY2RlZjAxMjM0NTY3ODlhYmNkZWY= \
  earnproof-api:local
```

On Linux, add `--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway`.

## Environment variables

Required in every profile. The process will not start without them:

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | none | PostgreSQL connection string. Rejected in production if the host is `localhost`, `127.0.0.1` or `0.0.0.0`. |
| `REDIS_URL` | none | Same host rule as `DATABASE_URL` in production. |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | none | Minimum 8 characters. Signs session tokens. |
| `CREDENTIAL_SIGNING_SECRET` | none | Minimum 8 characters. Rotating it invalidates every credential signed with the old value. |
| `PAYMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | none | 32 bytes, base64 or 64-character hex. Losing it makes stored payment amounts unreadable. |

Defaulted, but worth setting explicitly in production:

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` (set in the image) | `production` additionally requires HTTPS URLs and non-local database hosts. |
| `PORT` | `4000` (set in the image) | The health check reads this, so changing it keeps the probe correct. |
| `APP_URL` | `http://localhost:3000` | CORS origin. Must be `https://` in production. |
| `API_URL` | `http://localhost:4000` | Advertised API URL. Must be `https://` in production. |
| `STELLAR_NETWORK` | `testnet` | Mainnet is not supported yet. |
| `STELLAR_HORIZON_URL` | `https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org` | Must match the network passphrase. |
| `STELLAR_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE` | `Test SDF Network ; September 2015` | Determines signature validation. |
| `CONTRACT_ANCHORING_ENABLED` | `false` | Requires the Stellar CLI, a registry contract ID and an issuer address when enabled. |
| `CONTRACT_ANCHORING_REQUIRED` | `false` | When true, proof creation fails if on-chain registration fails. |

[`../.env.example`](../.env.example) is the complete list, including the
rate-limiting, retention and health-probe variables that are defaulted and rarely
changed. Every variable and its constraints are enforced by
[`../src/config/env.validation.ts`](../src/config/env.validation.ts).

Pass secrets as environment variables from your orchestrator's secret store, or
mount them as files and read them in an entrypoint. Do not bake them into an
image and do not pass them as build arguments: both end up in the image history.

## Database migrations

Migrations are not applied at startup. A replica that migrates on boot races
every other replica in the same rollout, and a failed migration becomes a crash
loop instead of a failed job. Run them as a separate step from the same image:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -e DATABASE_URL="$DATABASE_URL" \
  earnproof-api:local \
  npx prisma migrate deploy
```

## Health checks

The image declares a `HEALTHCHECK` against `/api/v1/health` every 30 seconds,
after a 20-second start period, failing the container after three consecutive
failures. That endpoint verifies database connectivity, so a container reporting
healthy has proven it can reach its dependencies.

For orchestrators, prefer the two probes that answer distinguishable questions:

| Probe | Endpoint | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| Liveness | `/api/v1/health/live` | Process availability only. Never fails because a dependency is down, so a database outage cannot trigger a restart storm. |
| Readiness | `/api/v1/health/ready` | `503` when a required dependency is unhealthy, so traffic stops being routed here. |

[`health-checks.md`](health-checks.md) documents what each probe checks and how
they are cached and timeout-bounded.

## Shutdown

`node` runs as PID 1 under the image's exec-form `CMD`, so `SIGTERM` from the
orchestrator reaches the process directly. Readiness flips to `not_ready` before
draining begins, which stops new traffic arriving while in-flight work finishes.
Give the container a termination grace period longer than the longest drain
documented in [`shutdown.md`](shutdown.md).

## Security posture

- **Non-root.** The runtime stage runs as the base image's `node` user (uid
  1000). Nothing in the image requires write access outside `/tmp`.
- **Minimal surface.** The runtime stage installs one package, `openssl`, which
  the Prisma query engine links against. There is no compiler, no `curl`, no
  `wget`; the health check uses Node's built-in `fetch`.
- **No secrets in the image.** No `ARG` carries a credential, and `.env` files
  are excluded from the build context.
- **Pinned base.** `node:20.11.1-alpine3.19`, matching `.nvmrc`. Rebuild and
  redeploy to pick up base-image security updates rather than floating a tag.
- **Read-only filesystem is supported.** The application writes nothing to disk:

  ```bash
  docker run --read-only --tmpfs /tmp ... earnproof-api:local
  ```
