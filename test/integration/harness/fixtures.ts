 * encrypt anything — `buildPayment` exposes a plaintext `amount` for assertions

 * encrypted column would train contributors to bypass the privacy boundary.

 * and insert it through the same encryption the application uses, so a row
 * written by a test is indistinguishable from a row written by the service.
