# EarnProof API - production image
#
# Three stages, because the thing that compiles the application and the thing
# that runs it need different contents: the builder needs the TypeScript
# toolchain and every devDependency, the runtime needs neither. Keeping them
# apart is what keeps a compiler, a test runner and the source tree out of a
# published image.
#
#   build            - installs everything, generates the Prisma client, compiles
#   production-deps  - installs runtime dependencies only, generates the client
#                      against that tree
#   runtime          - Prisma engine + node_modules + dist, nothing else
#
# The Prisma client is generated twice on purpose. `prisma generate` writes into
# node_modules/.prisma, so a client generated beside the devDependencies is not
# the one the runtime tree carries; generating it again in the pruned tree is
# cheaper and less fragile than copying a directory out of the middle of another
# stage's node_modules.
#
# Build:  docker build -t earnproof-api .
# Run:    see docs/deployment.md
