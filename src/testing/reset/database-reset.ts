/**
 * Destructive database reset, and the guards that stand in front of it.
 *
 * Seeding writes fabricated rows; a reset removes real ones. The failure mode
 * is therefore worse and irreversible, so the guard here is deliberately
 * stricter than the seed guard in
 * [`scenario.ts`](../factories/scenario.ts): as well as refusing production and
 * refusing an unrecognised host, it requires the operator to name the database
 * they are about to empty.
 *
 * Naming the target is the check that catches the accident the other rules
 * cannot. `NODE_ENV` and the host say what *kind* of environment this is; only
 * the database name says *which* one, and the realistic accident is a correct
 * command aimed at the wrong database — a shell that still holds staging's
 * `DATABASE_URL`, a `.env` loaded from the wrong directory.
