 * end — deletion or anonymisation.
 *
 * The full rationale is in `docs/data-retention.md`. This file is the
 * executable half; the two must change together.
 *
 * Durations are configurable per class so an operator can tighten retention
 * without a deploy, but every class has a default that is safe on its own. A
 * missing environment variable must never mean "keep forever".
