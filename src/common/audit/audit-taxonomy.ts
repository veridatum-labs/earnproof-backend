/**
 * The audit taxonomy: the single, stable description of what this service
 * promises to record when a security-relevant action happens.
 *
 * Why a taxonomy rather than a comment next to each write:
 *
 * Audit coverage decays silently. A new endpoint ships, nobody adds the write,
 * and nothing fails — the gap is only discovered when an incident needs the
 * evidence that was never captured. The taxonomy makes coverage a declared
 * artefact, so the matrix test (`audit-event-matrix.spec.ts`) can assert that
 * what the services persist still matches what is declared here, and
 * `docs/audit-events.md` can describe one list rather than nine.
 *
 * Three properties are declared per event and each one is asserted:
 *
 * 1. **Identity** — the persisted shape (`store` plus `match`) that identifies
 *    the event, and the stable `type` that names it. The persisted shape is a
 *    wire format with existing rows behind it and is deliberately *not*
 *    normalised here; the stable type is the name to use in alerts, runbooks
 *    and reports, and `resolveAuditEventType` maps one to the other.
 * 2. **Context** — which actor types may appear, which outcomes the event can
 *    carry, and where the tenant context is read from.
 * 3. **Write-failure behaviour** — whether a failed audit write fails the
 *    mutation (`fail_closed`) or is swallowed so the request still succeeds
 *    (`fail_open`). This is a security decision, so it is recorded rather than
 *    left to whichever `try` block happens to surround the write.
