 * megabyte of metadata, an array nested five hundred deep — costs memory, CPU
 * and database work before a single domain rule has an opinion about it.
 *
 * These limits are the earlier boundary. They are collected here rather than
 * spread across `main.ts` and a dozen DTOs so that the answer to "what is the
 * largest request this service accepts?" is one file, and so the tests in
 * `test/security/` can assert against the same numbers the application uses.
 *
 * Every value is a deliberate trade, and the reasoning is recorded next to it:
 * a limit whose justification is lost gets raised the first time it is
 * inconvenient.
