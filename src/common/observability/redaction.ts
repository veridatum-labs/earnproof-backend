/**
 * Redaction for operational log output.
 *
 * Logs are the one place where free-form text legitimately reaches an operator,
 * which makes them the place where sensitive values leak. An exception message
 * from Horizon, the Stellar CLI, or Prisma can carry a wallet address, a memo,
 * a signed payload, or a connection string with credentials — none of which the
 * responder needs and all of which the log will retain.
 *
 * This module redacts by *pattern*, not by field name, because the leak
 * normally arrives inside a string that was never a structured field:
 * `"tx failed for GABC…XYZ: insufficient balance 42.5 USDC"`.
 *
 * Redaction is deliberately conservative. It is better to blank an operationally
 * useful figure than to retain an identifier, so an amount-like token is
 * replaced even though amounts are occasionally useful in a diagnosis. The
 * shape of the error — which pattern matched, in what order — survives, and
 * that is what actually drives a runbook.
