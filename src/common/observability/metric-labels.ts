/**
 * Bounded label vocabulary for operational metrics.
 *
 * Two failure modes are prevented here, and they are different problems:
 *
 * 1. **Privacy.** A wallet address, proof ID, amount, memo, URL, signature, or
 *    raw error text must never become a metric dimension. Metrics are scraped,
 *    retained, and often shipped to third-party systems with weaker access
 *    controls than the database.
 *
 * 2. **Cardinality.** A label whose value set is unbounded multiplies series
 *    without limit. Even a privacy-safe identifier such as a request ID would
 *    make the metric useless and the backend expensive.
 *
 * Both are enforced at registration time rather than by convention, because a
 * convention that is only documented is a convention that eventually gets
 * violated by a well-meaning change under time pressure.
